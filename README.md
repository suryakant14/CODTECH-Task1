# Overview of the Project    
## Title of Project: Password Strength Checker     
## Problem Statement     
Develop a tool to assess the strength of passwords entered by users. Implement algorithms to analyze factors such as length, complexity, and uniqueness to provide feedback on password strength.

## Objective    
The Password Strength Checker project aims to design and develop a user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI) application that assesses the strength of user-inputted passwords based on various criteria such as length, uppercase letters, lowercase letters, and special characters. The application provides feedback to users on the strength of their passwords and suggests ways to improve them, while also keeping a record of previously used passwords to prevent reuse. By achieving these objectives, the project demonstrates an understanding of cybersecurity concepts such as password security, password cracking, and password analysis, while also developing problem-solving skills.

## Features    
The Password Strength Checker application provides the following features:
1. Password Strength Assessment: The application assesses the strength of user-inputted passwords based on four criteria: length, uppercase letters, lowercase letters, and special characters.
2. Password History: The application keeps a record of previously used passwords and warns users if they attempt to reuse a password.
3. Toggle Password Visibility: Users can toggle the visibility of their password input to ensure secure entry.
4. User-Friendly Interface: The application features a simple and intuitive GUI that makes it easy for users to interact with the password strength checker.
   
## Technical Details
The Password Strength Checker application is built using the following technologies:
1. Python: The application is written in Python, a popular programming language known for its simplicity and ease of use.
2. Tkinter: The application uses Tkinter, a Python library for building GUI applications, to create the user interface.
3. Regular Expressions: The application uses regular expressions to validate user-inputted passwords against the strength criteria.
   
## How to Use
To use the Password Strength Checker application, simply run the script and follow these steps:
1. Enter a password in the input field.
2. Click the "Check Strength" button to assess the password strength.
3. The application will display a message indicating the password strength and providing feedback on how to improve it.
4. If you attempt to reuse a previously used password, the application will warn you.
